**Avoid accidentally picking up furniture on your boat.**

Furniture cannot be picked up when it's on a boat except in the following conditions:
- Holding the modifier key (configurable, Left Alt by default)
- Crouching (can be disabled)

Options can be adjusted two ways:
- Editing the config file: Sailwind/BepInEx/config/com.nandbrew.furniturefix.cfg
- BepInEx Configuration manager: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases/latest
